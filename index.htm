<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 banner-desc">
<p>Are your electricity bills getting higher and higher each month, year by year? <strong>It's no coincidence!</strong></p>
<p>Retail residential electricity rates (the amount you pay per kilowatt-hour, or ¢/kWh) have sharply risen across the nation: <strong>about 27% over the last 3 years.</strong></p>
<p>This trend is unlikely to be disrupted in the future: natural gas prices are likely only to increase, and as they do, electricity rates will rise.
</p>
<h2 class="text-center bold">How Does it Actually Work?</h2>
<p>PowerVolt was designed to constantly improve and optimize your power stream, by capturing and straightening the current energy that would otherwise be lost. Once it is completely optimized, your electricity consumption will be lower.
</p>
<p>If your home is large, it is beneficial to place one unit close to the breaker box and additional units as far away from it as possible. It is as simple as that. We recommend 1 PowerVolt device for every 500 sq ft.</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerVolt is used for economizing electricity, effectively saving electricity and up to 60%-90% of electrical consumption for a heavy-duty load. <strong>The product saves you money right out of the box.</strong></li>
<li>The function of PowerVolt is to stabilize the voltage, balance the current, and offer surge protection in order to achieve a power-saving effect. The product itself has almost no consumption of energy, so you can use it to save power consumed by electric appliances, such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, televisions, and so on.</li>
<li>It is incredibly easy to use, plug into any socket or line. The LED light will become green immediately.</li>
<li>PowerVolt can abate electrical overheating when it operates normally at the rated load. The external shell has advanced fire-proof and explosion-proof material, and internal leakage protection measures make it safe and reliable. The longer the power energy saver is used, the better the effect will be. This is truly a great advantage for your household appliances.</li>
<li>PowerVolt is suitable for houses, condominiums, apartments, shop lots, restaurants, offices, small factories, etc.; however, there are no electricity saving benefits for heating appliances, such as electric stoves, electronic cookers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="bold">“Very happy and beyond impressed with this new technology.”</h4>
<p>My brother in law told me about PowerVolt and showed me his electric bill a couple of months after installing a few of them in his 2000 sqft ranch. He was getting a 58% reduction in energy costs. I decided to go with the recommended 1 PowerVolt device for every 500 sqft. My home is about 2600 sqft, so I got 5 of them. I was in shock when I got my energy bill the following the month.. an 83% reduction in energy costs!!! I'm not blowing smoke!!! This device flat out works. </p>

<h4 class="bold">“Finally a product that works”</h4>
<p>As an electrician, I know devices and home appliances draw more power than they use. However, it's the power you have to pay for. PowerVolt handles these inefficiencies by improving the power stream. That way you only pay for the electricity you consume.</p>

<p>For years, I knew I was getting hosed by these utility outfits. Honestly, I never considered the fact that something like this could exist but after reading about the science behind it, it makes sense. I'll just say this: DON'T get yourself one if you HATE having extra money in the bank every month!!</p>

Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified as belonging to you, such as your full name, email address, mailing address, phone number, billing, credit card information, etc.).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some areas of this Website may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, and order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is optional.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>We may disclose your personal information to contractors or service providers that help us provide services to you or deliver products to you. For example, we will disclose your billing information to payment processors to process your order transaction, shipping address to shipping contractors to deliver a product to you, and, at times, your email address to email fulfillment contractors to send you emails from us. We may share some or all of your personal information with our parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control, in which case we will request that these affiliates honor this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We may disclose your personal information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas, judicial proceedings, court orders, or warrants served on us; or (b) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of third parties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>From time to time, we make the email addresses of those who access our Website, or otherwise provide an email address to us, available to other organizations. If you do not want us to share your email address with other companies or organizations, please let us know by calling customer service at 8552270908.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding products, services, and/or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please let us know by calling customer service at 8552270908.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Security of Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can be assured that personal information collected through the Website is secure and is maintained in a manner consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all personal information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. Your personal information is protected in several ways. Your personal information resides on a secure server that only select PowerVolt employees and contractors have access to via password. In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third-party vendors, processing agents, and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) There are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) The security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed; and (c) Any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this Website, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive Information Collection</strong></p>
<p><strong>As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Website may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider (ISP) so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our Website, and administer and improve services to our consumers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the website remember information about you and your preferences. This Website uses cookies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Session cookies" are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This Website uses session cookies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Persistent cookies" are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete them. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., a username), helping to determine what areas of the website users find most valuable, and customizing the website based on your preferences. This Website uses persistent cookies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Internet tags" (also known as pixels, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell a website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the user’s computer. This Website uses Internet tags.</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) and Internet tags are used for system management, to improve the content of a website, market research purposes, and to communicate information to users. This Website uses navigational data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mail, E-mail or SMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Provided you have agreed to this, we may use your personal or other information to send you information on new services or products that may be of interest to you. This may include mail, e-mail or SMS information concerning us, our products and services, or our partners and their products or services. If you do not wish to continue receiving this information you may contact us and we will remove you from our mailing list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internet-Based Online Advertisements</strong></p>
<p><strong>We, or a data provider we have engaged, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content, or services. No personally identifiable information is on or connected to these cookies. Customized ads are intended to be relevant to you based on information we or an online advertising network serving the ad collect about your online activities here and elsewhere over time. For example, anonymous information collected across multiple Internet sites that you visit over time may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. Some of these networks may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program. To learn more about your choices relating to networks that participate in the DAA Program, including how to opt out of this category of advertising, please visit&nbsp;<a href="index.htm#">http://aboutads.info/choices</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Website may contain links to websites of third parties not affiliated with Force Factor. This Privacy Policy will not apply to these third-party websites and this Website is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any of these other websites, even where these third-party websites indicate a special relationship or "partnership" with this Website. In most cases, we do not disclose personally identifiable information to those responsible for the linked websites. The linked websites, however, may collect personal information from you when you visit their website. This collection of information is not subject to the control of this Website. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policies of the websites you visit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy may change over time. We may notify you by email to the email address associated with your account when we make substantive changes to this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the changed version (for example, if you do not approve of a different way that we intend to use personal information), you may let us know by calling us at 8552270908. If you do not respond with any objections, we will assume that you consent to the changes in the Privacy Policy. Changes will not apply retroactively to personal information that was collected before the changes to the Privacy Policy were made, except as may be required by law.&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>In addition to these Terms of Service, you also agree to be bound by the additional service-specific terms applicable to services you purchase from, or that are provided by, PowerVolt‘s partners or other third parties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PowerVolt may from time to time recommend, provide you with access to, or enable third party software, applications (ï¿½Appsï¿½), products, services or website links (collectively, “Third Party Services”) for your consideration or use. Such Third-Party Services are made available only as a convenience, and your purchase, access or use of any such Third-Party Services is solely between you and the applicable third-party services provider (“Third-Party Provider”). Any use by you of Third Party Services offered through the Services or PowerVoltï¿½s website is entirely at your own risk and discretion, and it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions and/or privacy policies applicable to such Third-Party Services before using them. In some instances, PowerVolt may receive a revenue share from Third Party Providers that PowerVolt recommends to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We do not provide any warranties with respect to Third Party Services. You acknowledge that PowerVolt has no control over Third Party Services and shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for such Third-Party Services. The availability of Third Party Services on PowerVolt websites, including the PowerVolt App Store, or the integration or enabling of such Third-Party Services with the Services does not constitute or imply an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation by or with PowerVolt. PowerVolt does not guarantee the availability of Third Party Services and you acknowledge that PowerVolt may disable access to any Third-Party Services at any time in its sole discretion and without notice to you. PowerVolt is not responsible or liable to anyone for discontinuation or suspension of access to, or disablement of, any Third-Party Service.

<h2><strong>Section 20. DMCA Notice and Takedown Procedure</strong></h2>
<p><strong>PowerVolt supports the protection of intellectual property and asks PowerVolt merchants to do the same. Itï¿½s our policy to respond to all notices of alleged copyright infringement. If someone believes that one of our merchants is infringing their intellectual property rights, they can send a DMCA Notice to PowerVoltï¿½s designated agent using our form. Upon receiving a DMCA Notice, we may remove or disable access to the Materials claimed to be a copyright infringement. Once provided with a notice of takedown, the merchant can reply with a counter notification using our form if they object to the complaint. The original complainant has 14 business days after we receive a counter notification to seek a court order restraining the merchant from engaging in the infringing activity, otherwise we restore the material. For more information, see our&nbsp;DMCA Notice and Takedown Procedure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PowerVolt respects intellectual property rights and you should too. If we receive a DMCA Notice, we may disable access or remove the allegedly infringing content from your website. If you don‘t think the claim is valid, you can proceed with a counter notification.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you believe one of our merchants is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send PowerVolt a DMCA Notice. We will expeditiously disable access or remove the content and notify the merchant. Be advised that we post all notices we receive.</strong></p>
